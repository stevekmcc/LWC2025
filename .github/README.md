# LWC25

This repository shows a [MetaEdit+](https://metacase.com/) implementation of the Questionnaire Language (QL), as part of the [Language Workbench Challenge 2025](https://github.com/judithmichael/lwb25).
The metamodels, models and generators can be viewed and edited with MetaEdit+ (e.g. the [free evaluation version](https://metacase.com/download/)). You can also [take a quick look at the models](https://stevekmcc.github.io/LWC2025/) in a clickable HTML format, which is automatically generated to GitHub.
